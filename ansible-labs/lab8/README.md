# Ansible Playbook: MySQL Setup
This repository contains an Ansible playbook to automate the installation and configuration of MySQL on a target host. The playbook installs MySQL, creates a database, sets up a user with privileges, and enables remote access to the MySQL server.


## Objective

1. Ansible installation and configuration

2. ssh configuration on the worker nodes(ubuntu)

3. Generating the control nodeâ€™s(macos) ssh keys

4. Adding the worker nodes(ubuntu) to the inventory file

5. MYSQL installation with ansible

6. Connecting to the database on worker nodes

## steps
### 1-Configure SSH (macos)
```bash
Host ivolve
    HostName 192.168.105.11
    User hager
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    IdentitiesOnly yes
```
### 2- Ping the ubuntu to confirm connectivity
```bash
ansible -m ping ivolve :

ivolve | SUCCESS => {
    "ansible_facts": {
        "discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python3.12"
    },
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}  
```
### 3- lab Structure 
1. ansible.cfg
This file configures Ansible settings and make 
#### vault_password_file: 
the file containing the Vault password for automation
```bash
[defaults]
inventory = ./inventory
vault_password_file = .vault_pass
```
2. inventory
This file defines the target hosts for the playbook
```bash
[web]
ivolve
```
3. vault.yml
This file stores  database username and password encrypted using Ansible Vault

```bash
ansible-vault create vault.yml

db_user: "hagert"
db_pass: "1234"
```
4. Playbook Content
The playbook performs the following tasks:
   - Updates the APT cache.
   - Installs MySQL Server, MySQL Client, and required dependencies.
   - Starts and enables the MySQL service. 
   - Creates a MySQL user with all privileges on the ivovle database.
   - Creates the ivovle database. 
   - Configures MySQL to allow remote access by modifying the bind-address  in the MySQL configuration file.
   - Restarts the MySQL service to apply changes.

5. Run the Playbook
when you run playbook, Ansible will automatically use the password from .vault_pass to decrypt any Vault-encrypted files:
```bash
ansible-playbook playbook.yml
```

## Verification
Log in to the MySQL server and Check if the ivolve database was created
